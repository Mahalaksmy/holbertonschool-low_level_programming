## What is a Doubly Linked List?

 Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

# Advantages over singly linked list 
* A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction. 
* The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given. 
* We can quickly insert a new node before a given node. 
* In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.
